# Predicting Sentiment from Product Reviews

The goal of this project is to explore logistic regression and feature engineering with sklearn.

We will use product review data from Amazon.com to predict whether the sentiments about a product (from its reviews) are positive or negative. Specifically, we will:

- Use Pandas DataFrames to perform feature engineering
- Train a logistic regression model to predict the sentiment of product reviews
- Inspect the weights (coefficients) of a trained logistic regression model
- Make a prediction (both class and probability) of sentiment for a new product review
- Given a classifier, create a confusion matrix
- Compare multiple logistic regression models
